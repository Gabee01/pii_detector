# NotionEventWorker Refactoring Summary

## Problem
The `NotionEventWorker` module was violating the Single Responsibility Principle by handling too many responsibilities:
1. Event reception and parsing
2. Page content fetching and processing
3. PII detection
4. Page archiving
5. Recursive child page processing

This made the code difficult to maintain, test, and understand.

## Solution
We refactored the code by extracting distinct responsibilities into their own modules:

### 1. `PIIDetector.Workers.Event.NotionEventWorker`
- **Single Responsibility**: Event handling and delegation
- **Key Functions**: 
  - `perform/1`: Processes Oban job and delegates to appropriate handlers
  - `process_by_event_type/3`: Routes events to the correct processor

### 2. `PIIDetector.Platform.Notion.EventDataExtractor`
- **Single Responsibility**: Extract important data from Notion event payloads
- **Key Functions**:
  - `get_page_id_from_event/1`: Extract page ID from various event formats
  - `get_user_id_from_event/1`: Extract user ID from various event formats

### 3. `PIIDetector.Platform.Notion.PageProcessor`
- **Single Responsibility**: Process Notion pages for PII
- **Key Functions**:
  - `process_page/3`: Main entry point for page processing
  - `process_page_content/4`: Process full page content
  - `archive_page/1`: Handle archiving when PII is found

### 4. `PIIDetector.Platform.Notion.PIIPatterns`
- **Single Responsibility**: Quick detection of common PII patterns
- **Key Functions**:
  - `check_for_obvious_pii/1`: Perform regex-based PII detection
  - `extract_page_title/1`: Helper to extract page titles

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Better Testability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test in isolation
3. **Enhanced Readability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand
4. **Easier to Extend**: Adding new features or modifying existing ones is simpler
5. **Separation of Concerns**: API interaction, event handling, and business logic are properly separated

## Testing
All existing tests pass, confirming that the refactoring preserves the original functionality while improving the code structure.

## Future Improvements
Further opportunities for improvement:
1. Create a `NotionContentFetcher` module to handle all API interactions
2. Extract recursive processing logic to its own module
3. Implement more specific error handling for each module
