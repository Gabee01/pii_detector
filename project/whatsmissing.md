Things to finish/try before delivery:
- support Notion database detection
- Try to update top-level pages to remove PII
- Files support (Image and PDF at least)

Nice to have:
- Make an index page with:
  - button to join slack channel
  - button to join notion workspace
- Documentation
  - It's pretty good already, but I'd like to do another run trough and double check some things
  - Generate exdocs
    - Add markdown docs as guides
- 100% coverage?
