Things to try before delivery:
- [ ] Find user email on slack and notify notion deletion
- [ ] Try to update top-level pages to remove PII

Nice to have:
- Make an index page with:
  - button to join slack channel
  - button to join notion workspace
- Documentation
  - It's pretty good already, but I'd like to do another run trough and double check some things
  - Generate exdocs
    - Add markdown docs as guides
- 100% coverage?
